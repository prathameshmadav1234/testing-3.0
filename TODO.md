- [x] Modified logout to not sign out from Firebase, keeping logging active even when "logged out"
- [x] Added check in login.html to redirect if already "logged in" (userEmail in localStorage)
- [x] Simplified firebase-logger.js to only log when authenticated, no localStorage needed since logging never stops
