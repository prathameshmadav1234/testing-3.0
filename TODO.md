# TODO: Ensure Logging Continues in Background During Logout

## Completed:
- [x] Modify firebase-logger.js: Always run the updater, store logs in localStorage when not authenticated, and upload stored logs to Firebase on login.
- [x] Update index.html: Remove stopUpdater call from logout function to allow continuous logging.
- [x] Update TODO.md: Reflect the new implementation for background logging.
