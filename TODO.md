# TODO: Centralize Logs in Firebase for Cross-Device Consistency

## Completed:
- [x] Modify firebase-logger.js: Change storage to Firebase Realtime Database under /logs/{userUID}/{date}, using authenticated user's UID. Ensure logging only when authenticated. Add error handling.
- [x] Update excel.html: Fetch logs from Firebase instead of localStorage, with real-time updates using onValue. Update renderTable, loadLogsByDate, downloadCSV, clearLogs functions.
- [x] Remove localStorage logging code from index.html: Remove getLogs, saveLogs, fetchData logging logic from the script.
- [x] Remove localStorage logging code from login.html: Remove background logging script or localStorage usage.
- [x] Remove localStorage usage from firebase-logger.js: Ensure no localStorage calls remain.
- [x] Fix button functions in excel.html: Make downloadCSV, clearLogs, goBack functions global for onclick events.
- [x] Test logging and viewing on multiple devices after login.
- [x] Verify real-time updates in excel.html.
