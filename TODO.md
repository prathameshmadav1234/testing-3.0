# TODO: Ensure Excel Report Updates on Logout

## Completed Tasks:
- [x] Modify firebase-logger.js: Export the `fetchData` function to allow calling from other scripts.
- [x] Modify index.html: Update the `logout` function to await a final `fetchData()` call before signing out, ensuring the latest data is logged to Firebase.

## Followup Steps:
- [ ] Test the logout process to verify the logs are updated with the latest data.
- [ ] Check for any console errors during logout.
- [ ] Ensure the app still functions correctly after changes.
